Comment:
 The upstream sources at the moment only says this:
 .
   The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [2-Clause BSD
   License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).
 .
 Upstream has been asked to explicitly include the full source of the license.
 There is an [open issue](https://github.com/ruby/ruby2_keywords/issues/4) and
 an open pull [request](https://github.com/ruby/ruby2_keywords/pull/5) to
 that effect.
 .
 However, given they explicitly link to the license definition in the OSI site,
 the actual distribution terms should be unambiguous enough.
